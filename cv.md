### About Myself:

During his studies at a medical university, he became interested in the IT field. At first it was just a hobby, the path started with the basics of Python. Later, I learned about such a specialty as a front-end developer. By a happy coincidence, I managed to find a job as a typewriter on the Tilda designer. This is how my journey in IT began.

Simple work with the designer was not enough for me. That's why I decided to continue studying the frontend, I mastered the basic package of Adobe programs (Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects) at the basic level in order to improve the website's visuals by improving and optimizing the content. Learned the basics of working in Figma.

At the moment, I am in the process of learning HTML, CSS, JS in order to become a professional Frontend Developer.
